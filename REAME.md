## Project Overview

This notebook provides Python-based solutions to analyze financial problems involving cash flow analysis. Key areas covered include:

- **Present Value (PV) Calculation**: Computing the PV of future cash flows given different interest rates.
- **Future Value (FV) Calculation**: Calculating the FV based on compounded interest over time.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Determining the impact of various interest rates on PV and FV for different cash flow amounts.

## Requirements

This notebook was developed in Python, using the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

To execute this notebook:

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Run each cell sequentially to calculate and visualize PV and FV across various scenarios.

## Structure

The notebook contains the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of financial concepts.
2. **PV and FV Calculations**: Functions and formulas for calculating PV and FV with user-defined parameters.
3. **Data Visualization**: Graphs to help visualize how changes in interest rates and cash flows affect PV and FV.
4. **Results Interpretation**: Insights on the financial data derived from PV and FV calculations.

## Results

- **PV Analysis**: Shows the present value of different cash flows under specified interest rates.
- **FV Analysis**: Presents future values for various cash flow scenarios with different compounding interest rates.
- **Graphical Outputs**: Visualizations provide an intuitive understanding of the impact of interest rate changes.
